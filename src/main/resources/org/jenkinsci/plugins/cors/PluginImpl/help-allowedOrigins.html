<div>
<b>allowedOrigins</b>, a comma separated list of origins that are
allowed to access the resources. Default value is <b>*</b>, meaning
all origins (but please note that, according to the spec, this will
not be accepted by browsers when allowCredentials=true).<br /> If an
allowed origin contains one or more * characters (for example
http://*.domain.com), then "*" characters are converted to ".*", "."
characters are escaped to "\." and the resulting allowed origin
interpreted as a regular expression.<br />  Allowed origins can
therefore be more complex expressions such as
https?://*.domain.[a-z]{3} that matches http or https, multiple
subdomains and any 3 letter top-level domain (.com, .net, .org, etc.).
