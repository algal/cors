<div>
<b>allowedOrigins</b>, a comma-separated list of the ascii
serializations of origins that are allowed to access the resources. An
ascii serialized origin looks like a URL containing only the scheme,
the authority, the port number (if it's non-default for that scheme),
and no path component. For example, two valid origins are
http://foo.com, or http://foo.com:8080.<br/>The default value
is <b>*</b>, meaning allow all origins. In this case, the server
echoes back whatever origin was provided by the request header.<br />
If an allowed origin contains one or more "*" characters (for example
http://*.domain.com), then "*" characters are converted to ".*", "."
characters are escaped to "\."  and the resulting string is
interpreted as a regular expression. Allowed origins can therefore be
more complex expressions: such as http://*.example.com, which matches
any subdomain of example.com; or https?://*.example.[a-z]{3}(:[0-9]+)?
which matches a scheme of http or https, all subdomains, any 3 letter
top-level domain, and any port number (.com, .net, .org, etc.).
